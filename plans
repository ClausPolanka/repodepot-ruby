- Add in csv read and normalization for non-string typed
  fields
- Have commits on Repository return a new Repository
  which has only the CodeEvent for that commit
- Have functions on repository which give a slice of commits
  by sha or date
- Add a declared_methods collection on Repository for all of
  the methods in the repository.  Will be very easy if
  CodeEvent gets  full_method_name method.  Then it is
  just a group_by on the original events
- Make sure that group_by preserves order.  If unable to,
  embedded date sort checks across the code that can be
  toggled.
- Consider adding a changed_methods method which looks
  at the current and last commit and gives the complexity
  delta -- needed now as we have code events for methods
  just because they are in a file.  May decide that
  it is better to just handle this with external code.
- Clean up CodeEvent
- Right now, Method doesn't inherit from CodeHistory.
  Any need to?
- Create a Diff class with removed_methods, changed_methods, added_methods
  working off of two histories
