- Do large commits (in terms of the delta of complexity) occur
  with equal frequency across the day?
- Is commit size correlated with weighted complexity?
- Is commit size correlated with the time since last commit?
- Are large deltas in a complex method's life line correlated
  with large changes?
- Can we identify extract method?
